Ok, here's how this works:
Dodge -- The stat is the chance you negate ALL damage
Armour -- The stat is the chance you negate SOME of the damage, MIGHT do a debuff on enemy for Armour
Regen -- The stat is the chance you regenerate a random amount of health
Health -- The stat is the amount of hitpoints until you lose
Damage -- The stat is how much damage you do, there are chances of doing full, major, or minor amounts of that damage
